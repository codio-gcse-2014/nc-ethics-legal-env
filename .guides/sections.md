How many computers and mobile phones have you had while growing up? What about other items of technology, what do you do with them once you’ve replace them with something newer, faster or better?

What do you do with old, unwanted or broken electrical items? Do you throw them away? Recycle them? Have you ever wondered what happens to electrical items once recycled?

In this video we will be speaking about environmental and ethical considerations that need to be in place with the technology that we use.

## Environmental Considerations
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) regulations have been setup by the European Union since 2007 to encourage consumers to recycle unwanted electrical items, known as ‘eWaste’. The Environment Agency encourages all manufactures to mark all new products placed on the market with a logo.

According to the Environment Agency, the UK throws away 2 million tonnes of WEEE each year and there is a growing concern to the amount of waste we are throwing away. 

So what can we do with all this eWaste?

## Recycling
The EU has put together the WEEE regulations to make sure less eWaste goes to landfi ll and instead the valuable materials found inside everyday electrical items thrown away are instead recycled.

Did you know that there is steel found in electrical toasters and Nickel in old kettles. For example the Zinc found in old mobile phones could be reused in ship building and the Gold and Platinum found in a computer or consoles could be melted down to make jewellery.

Do you know where your local WEEE recycle point is? You can use [this website](http://www.recyclenow.com/why_recycling_matters/electricals/index.html) to find out where your local centre is.

## Ethical considerations of recycling eWaste
Instead of recycling we could donate working electrical items to charity or to developing countries to reuse. 

However, according to Greenpeace, many old products that are being exported to developing countries might have some short term benefits, but in the long term these items are being dumped and are
contributing to the countries waste management problems.

Globally we have a real problem that is emerging. For example, it costs $30 for a computer to be recycled in the United States and $2 to recycle the same computer in China. Therefore western companies prefer to ship these items to be disposed to China, India and Pakistan.

It is legal for countries to export items to developing countries for reuse or refurbishment, but according to Interpol and the Guardian, many items sent are incorrectly classifi ed to avoid recycling costs and are actually waste items which are lost on the black market to avoid the legitimate costs of recycling.

Ever wondered what the actual electricity cost is for keeping electrical items at home on standby instead of switching them off? According to “The Energy Saving Trust” an average home spends between £45 to £80 a year in electrical costs for keeping items on standby.

You might not think that’s a lot of money over a year, but think how much wasted electricity that is, now multiply that by each household on your street, in your town and across the country! That’s a lot of wasted electricity.

Different items have different energy effi ciency ratings, and we are encouraged to consider an energy efficient item when purchasing it.

Did you know that a laptop can use up to 85% less electricity when compared to a desktop PC? Older laptops would become incredibly hot when used for long periods, if you compare this with some newer laptops they have more efficient parts inside them to prevent the laptops from heating up, they also use less electricity and there is therefore less waste.

The fan attached to a PC, on a computer, is always on while the computer is on. The purpose of the fan is to make sure the computer’s CPU remains at a constantly low temperature.

Now if we think about how things are maintained on a larger scale in Data Centres their level of wasted electricity increases in order to keep all those computers and components cooled down, air conditioning units are powered 24/7 to constantly make sure that the servers are at a constant temperature. According to 4d-dc offering an environmentally friendly data centre alternative:

“5% of Europe’s annual energy bill is spent just on cooling computers. In legacy data centres (usually those computers older than 5 years), this can often account for nearly 40% of the power consumed.”

This alternative method offered if adopted by a data centre could decrease their energy usage by 88.9% which just goes to show how much energy is wasted in cooling these systems.

## Computing Ethics for Professionals
Medics and Lawyers can only practice in their field if they belong to a self-regulating professional organisation. The Computing profession is still relatively new; there has not been the organisational capability to develop a binding set of moral rules.

The British Computing Society has published a ‘Code of Conduct’ they expect their members to follow. These outline a duty to be followed by professionals and outline expected moral behaviour. Although these are not legislated in law, members can be expelled from the society if they do not adhere to the code of conduct.

The code of conduct covers four important areas:

- Obligation to public interest
- Professional competence and integrity
- Duty to relevant authority
- Duty to the profession

By adopting a professional code an organisation benefi ts from gaining in public trust. The profession uses the code of conduct to self-regulate the behaviours of its members. The code of conduct instils ethically values, which is acceptable behaviour.

Ethical codes of practice are needed as computer professionals have access to a lot of sensitive information that could be misused. A computer professional will have access to a company’s data, as well as fi nancial and medical records, the code of ethics sets clear guidelines of what is expected from individuals working under the trust of their employers.

The law has an important role to play when it comes to computer systems and espeically software applications such as social media. 

There are some specific acts in law that relate to computer systems

- The Data Protection Act 1998
- The Computer Misuse Act 1998
- Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1998

## The Data Protection Act 1998
This governs the way in which companies have to look after data they hold about us. The following organizations all hold data about us, such as

- Doctors
- Banks
- Web shops 
- Social media sites
- Web applications where you sign up and supply private information

If a company wishes to hold data about us, they must first register with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). There are 8 princpiles that they must adhere to

- Data must be processed fairly
- It can only be used for the purposes they have stated
- They should only hold data they actually need
- Data must be accurate and up to date
- Data must not be held longer than it is needed for
- Data will be used in accordance with your rights
- Data will be kept safe
- Data will not be transferred to any country where they do not have similar laws

In most cases, if data is held about you, you have the rght to seei it and if it is incorrect, you can insist it is changed.

In 2011, hackers managed to break into Sony's computer systems and steal information about individuals held on their Playstation network.

Sony were heavily criticised and the ICO decided that Sony had failed to keep its systems security up to date with general technical security developments.

This was in breach of the principle that data data should be kept safe. As a result, the ICO fined Sony £250,000.

## Computer Misuse Act
Of course, hacking into a computer system is in itself illegal. This is covered by the Computer Misuse Act, which focuses on unauthorised access to computer systems. 

The Act covers three crimes

- Attempting to access a computer system to access information that you know you are not authorised to access. Note the use of the word *attempt*, as you do not have to be successful to be in breach of the law. Attempting to guess someone's password is in breach of the Computer Misuse Act, even if your guesses were wrong.
- Attemping to access computer system with the intention of committing a further crime. This could be trying to access personal data with the intention of committing identity theft.
- Unauthorised access a computer system with the intention of changing data held on it or to impair the running of the computer system. This offense can lead to a jail sentence of up to 10 years in the UK.

## Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1998
This acts prevents work from being copied without permission. This would typically cover

- Text
- Images
- Video 
- Music
- Software

If someone else takes a photograph and publishes it, it is against the law for someone to copy it. 

People have been breaking copyright law long before the Internet but the Internet has made it much easier to do so.

File sharing websites and peer-to-peer networks have meant that large amounts of copyright material are being shared online, much to the concern of the film and music industry.

There are, however, many more laws about computer and Internet use. As uses of the Internet develo, the law is having to be applied in new ways. 

For example, there have been cases of people being sued for lible for posts they have made on Twitter. 

You also need to keep in mind that use of the Internet spans the world and what may be legal in the UK may not be legal in other countries. 

- Some countries have very strict rules about the sort of material that people are allowed to access.
- Some countries have strong rules on the use of encryption

This has become an increasingly complex area and people have to become aware of their online actions.
